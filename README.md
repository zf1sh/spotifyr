Hi! This is a WIP project where I use the Spotifyr R Wrapper and Spotify API to analyze different aspects of artist's discographies. I'll be creating and adding tools that take artist names as input and return the desired data for the artist. As of May 15th 2025, Spotify significantly reduced the usability of their API for small developers, so I'm using as much as I possibly can from their API to make something usable / fun.
